    "To perform the ESFCA method, three types of data are required, as follows: (1) road network, (2) population, and (3) hospital information. The road network can be obtained from the [OpenStreetMap Python Library, called OSMNX](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx). The population data is available on the [American Community Survey](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/deeplinks?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffactfinder.census.gov%2F&tid=GOVSTIMESERIES.CG00ORG01). Lastly, hospital information is also publically available on the [Homelanad Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data](https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/hospitals?geometry=-94.504%2C40.632%2C-80.980%2C43.486)."

    "Function written by Joe Holler + Derrick Burt. A more efficient way to calculate distance-weighted catchment areas for each hospital. First, create a dictionary (with a node and its corresponding drive time from the hospital) of all nodes within a 30 minute drive time (using networkx single_cource_dijkstra_path_length function). From here, two more dictionaries are constructed by querying the original one. From these dictionaries, single part convex hulls are created for each drive time interval and appended into a single list (one list with 3 polygon geometries). Within the list, the polygons are differenced from each other to produce three catchment areas.\n",
